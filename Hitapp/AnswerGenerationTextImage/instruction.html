	<h3> What is this HIT about?</h3>
	<p>We are trying to build a question-answering system which is able to retrieve
		the
		answer by reasoning over multiple facts/images. This is the way we human typically
		use to
		find an answer. For example, when this question is asked:</p>
	<p><b>Has there always been a rivalry between Daffy Duck and Porky Pig?</b></p>
	<p>We might find the answer by</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Searching Wikipedia for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daffy_Duck" target="_blank">Daffy Duck</a>.
		</li>
		<li>"Daffy first appeared in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porky%27s_Duck_Hunt" target="_blank">Porky's
				Duck Hunt</a>, released on April 17, 1937."
		</li>
		<li>"Porky shoots the whiskey-filled barrel but Daffy escapes" or "Daffy
			bites
			Porky on the nose"</li>
		<li>Conclude, <b>Yes, Daffy and Porky have been rivals since their first
				appearance on screen.</b></li>
	</ol>
	<p>However, for now, if you search a question in a search engine like Google or
		Bing, you are mostly like to get the answer from only one snippet of text. They
		don’t have the ability to answer the above question because, as you can see, the answer
		is concluded by reasoning the facts/images from multiple resources. We believe that
		this reasoning ability can greatly improve the question-answering ability of
		search engines, so we create this Hitapp and asking help from you. Appreciate your participation! </p>

	<h3>The Format:</h3>
	<p> Each hit starts with a question and group of text snippets provided by us that we think are sufficient to answer
		the question. These should contain all the information necessary to answer the question.. You may use these
		provided facts *only* to formulate your answers to the question..</p>
	<p> Note: if you think information provided in facts is not enough to answer the question please MARK as <b>cannot be
		answered</b></p>

	<h3> Can the information from the URL link of the fact be used in the answer?</h3>
	<p>In the following cases, the infromation from the URL link can be used in answer:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>If the provided information is <b>image(s)</b>, the information in the URL link to can be used in answer.</li>
		<li>If the provided information is <b>text snippets</b>, the information from the URL link can be used in answer <b>only if the fact text snippet has that information fully contained within it.</b></li>
	</ol>


	<!-- <h3>A valid answer should include:</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Shouldn’t be answered by only one fact:
			<p>Facts:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Hawa was born on December 16th, 1937 in Umarwas.</li>
				<li>Hawa enrolled in the Indian Army in 1956, and became the
					champion of the
					Western Command in 1960 by defeating the defending champion,
					Mohabbat
					Singh.</li>
			</ol>
			<p><span style="color:red">Bad question:</span>When is Hawa’s
				birthday.(can be
				answer by the first fact)</p>
			<p><span style="color:green">Good question:</span> How old was Hawa when
				he
				enrolled in the Indian Army? (need both facts)</p>
		</li>
		<li>Has definitive answer: The answer to your query cannot be too subjective
			or
			change from time to time.
			<ul>
				<li>How good is the view of Chicage from Willis Tower skydeck? (Too
					subjective)</li>
				<li>What is the weather in Manhattan? (Time sensitive)</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			Not about simple facts: The query cannot be answered blindly based on
			common
			sense (i.e. without using any of the text snippets).
			<ul>
				<li>Can a boat float on the water?</li>
				<li>How many wheels does a car have?</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
